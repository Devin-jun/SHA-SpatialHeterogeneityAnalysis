# SHA-SpatialHeterogeneityAnalysis
SHAï¼ŒA toolkit for genomics spatial heterogeneity analysis which is designed for a variety of spatial transcriptomics techniques such as **seqFISH+**, **MERFISH**, **10X Visium**.

SHA provides a series of spatial heterogeneity mining methods, including **spatial heterogeneity genes calculation**, **cell type and tissue area spatial entropy calculation**, **gene expression regulation network based on geographically weighted regression**, **spatial accessibility analysis**.

We analyzed different datasets from three domains: ***neurobiology, tumor biology, and developmental biology*** based on SHA computational frameworks.
